# VibriBot
 A Discord bot based on Vibri.



The only dependencies that this bot needs are

**discord.py** (of course)

**Pillow** and

**discord-py-slash-commands**


For tokens, get some bot tokens and place them in tokens.txt.

You might want to make 2 bots if you want a development bot.


For the new version, run `vibri.py`

For the old version, run `vibribbot.py`.
